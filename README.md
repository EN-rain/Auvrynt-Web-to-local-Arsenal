## What is Auvrynt?

Auvrynt is a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** you run on your own machine. It creates a secure, tunneled connection between AI clients like ChatGPT, Claude, or Grok and your local development environment — your actual files, terminals, build tools, and project folders.

No cloud upload. No third-party storage. Your code stays on your machine.

Connect once, then ask your AI to:

- Open any approved project folder on your machine
- Read, write, search, and edit real source files
- Run shell commands, tests, builds, and package scripts
- Work across web, .NET, Godot, Blender, and Aseprite projects
- Capture screenshots of running apps
- Use isolated Git worktrees for parallel coding sessions

---

## Quick Start

> **Requires:** Node.js `>=20.12 <27` — Node 22 LTS recommended

**Install globally:**

```bash
npm install -g auvrynt
```

**Set up and start:**

```bash
auvrynt start
```

`auvrynt start` creates local configuration automatically. Use `auvrynt init`
only when you want to configure foreground `auvrynt serve` manually.

**Or run directly without installing:**

```bash
npx auvrynt init
npx auvrynt start
```

During `auvrynt init`, you will be asked for:

| Prompt | Description |
|---|---|
| Project roots | Local folder paths your AI is allowed to access |
| Local port | Default is `49321` |
| Public base URL | The tunnel URL used by foreground `auvrynt serve` |

> **Important:** Provide the base URL — do **not** include `/mcp`. Example: `https://your-tunnel.trycloudflare.com`

---

## Start the Server

```bash
# Starts one managed background instance, scoped to the current directory
auvrynt start

# Check or stop the background instance
auvrynt status
auvrynt restart
auvrynt stop

# Switch the running workspace to this directory
cd C:\path\to\another-project
auvrynt change

# Foreground server with verbose request logs
auvrynt serve
```

When using foreground `auvrynt serve`, the terminal shows request activity. Background `auvrynt start` returns only after the local server and tunnel are ready; use `auvrynt status` to inspect the managed PID, workspace, profiles, and public URL.

---

`auvrynt start` starts one managed tunnel and one Auvrynt server in the background. Cloudflare is the default; run `auvrynt tunnel` to select ngrok and optionally save a reserved stable HTTPS origin. It does not keep the terminal occupied. The tunnel stays alive while profiles are added or replaced, so its URL remains the same until `auvrynt stop` or the managed tunnel process exits. A second start asks before changing the existing instance; use `--replace` when running non-interactively.

### Start only what you need

Profiles are session-only: they override saved integration choices for the current background instance without changing your config.

```bash
# One integration
auvrynt start model      # Blender MCP port detection
auvrynt start pixel      # Aseprite native CLI/Lua tools
auvrynt start web        # Playwright/browser tools
auvrynt start godotcs    # Godot C#
auvrynt start godotgd    # Godot GDScript
auvrynt start se         # Serena

# Multiple integrations
auvrynt start model,godotcs

# Add an integration live; neither the server nor tunnel restarts
auvrynt add web

# Replace profiles live when the workspace is unchanged
auvrynt start se --replace
```

Live profile changes wait until no tool execution is active, then update the local integration gate without closing connected MCP sessions. They do not restart Auvrynt, the managed tunnel, Blender, Godot, Serena, or tracked development processes. Starting with `--replace` from a different directory gracefully changes the managed workspace while preserving the tunnel.

`auvrynt restart` reloads Auvrynt code while keeping the current managed tunnel and URL. `auvrynt restart hard` stops and recreates both. `auvrynt stop` gracefully stops Auvrynt and then its tunnel. These commands do not close Blender or Godot. Lifecycle commands are serialized, so two terminals cannot create duplicate managed instances. Assigned Cloudflare/ngrok URLs may change after a hard restart; a reserved `AUVRYNT_NGROK_URL` remains stable while available.

Generated artifacts are kept under the active workspace's `auvrynt-logs` directory instead of being scattered through the project. Playwright screenshots, responsive captures, image diffs, sprite frames, application captures, Godot exports, Blender exports, and Blender checkpoints use organized subdirectories such as `auvrynt-logs/playwright` and `auvrynt-logs/images`. Normal source edits and generated project source files still use their requested project paths.

## Connect an MCP Client

Primary MCP connectors are ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok. Lovable and Bolt are
supported extra connectors.

Paste your `/mcp` URL into the connector setup for one of these clients:

| Connector | Setup location |
| --- | --- |
| ChatGPT | ChatGPT connector/app settings |
| Claude | Claude connector settings |
| Grok | `grok.com/connectors` → **New Connector** → **Custom** |
| Lovable | Lovable MCP connectors |
| Bolt | Bolt MCP connectors |

Use the public HTTPS URL ending in `/mcp`, not the local dashboard URL:

```
https://your-tunnel.trycloudflare.com/mcp
```

When the client connects, Auvrynt opens a local approval page that requires your **Owner token**. Normal startup keeps that secret hidden; retrieve it only when needed with:

```bash
auvrynt token
```

It is stored locally in `~/.auvrynt/auth.json`. Keep it private and do not paste it into the MCP client itself.

Client registrations and hashed authorization sessions are stored locally and survive `auvrynt restart` and `auvrynt change` while the same public origin remains active. You should not need to approve the connector again after either command.

Authorization is required again after `auvrynt token reset` or any operation that changes the public origin, including a hard restart of an assigned tunnel. A hard restart using the same reserved ngrok origin keeps the OAuth issuer/resource origin unchanged. If a connector already reports `invalid id`, remove and recreate that connector once with the current `/mcp` URL.

## Project Routing

Auvrynt automatically selects the right workflow guide based on your project type:

| Project signals | Guide loaded |
|---|---|
| `package.json` + `vite.config.ts` / web framework | Web Agent Guide |
| `App.sln` / `.csproj` without `project.godot` | Software Agent Guide |
| `project.godot` (any language) | Godot Agent Guide |
| `.blend` files | Blender Agent Guide |
| `.aseprite` / `.ase` files | Aseprite Agent Guide |

See [`PROJECT_ROUTER.md`](guides/PROJECT_ROUTER.md) for full routing rules.
