# Setup Guide

This guide is for users who want ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Lovable, Bolt, or another MCP host to work in local
projects through Auvrynt.

## Requirements

- Node `>=20.12 <27`; Node 22 LTS is recommended
- npm
- Git for Windows (includes the Bash runtime used by agent shell tools)
- Windows PowerShell or cmd.exe
- Internet access for the managed Cloudflare quick tunnel

`auvrynt start` installs Cloudflare Tunnel when needed and creates a temporary
public URL automatically.

## Install And Start

Run:

```powershell
npm install -g auvrynt
cd C:\path\to\your\project
auvrynt start
```

The first start creates local configuration and asks which optional
integrations to enable. The launch directory becomes the only project root
available to that managed instance.

Run `auvrynt init` only if you want to configure foreground `auvrynt serve`
manually. That setup flow asks one question at a time:

### Project Roots

Choose the folders ChatGPT is allowed to open through Auvrynt. Keep this
narrow.

Example: `C:\Users\alice\dev,C:\Users\alice\work`.

### Local Port

The default is `49321`.

The local MCP URL is:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:49321/mcp
```

### Public Base URL

This setting applies to foreground `auvrynt serve`; managed `auvrynt start`
creates its own Cloudflare URL. Point your independently managed tunnel at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:49321
```

Enter the public origin without `/mcp`:

```text
https://your-tunnel-host.example.com
```

Configure the MCP client with the full MCP endpoint:

```text
https://your-tunnel-host.example.com/mcp
```

## Start The Server

Run:

```powershell
auvrynt start
```

The command starts in the background and returns only after both the local
server and Cloudflare tunnel are ready. It always limits web-agent file access
to the directory where you ran it.

Use `auvrynt add web` (or another profile) to update the running instance
without restarting the server or tunnel. Use `auvrynt restart` to reload only
the Auvrynt server while preserving the tunnel URL, `auvrynt restart hard` to
recreate both processes, or `auvrynt stop` to stop both managed processes.

To move the running web-agent boundary to another project without changing the
tunnel URL, open that directory and run:

```powershell
auvrynt change
```

For an independently managed stable URL, configure it and use foreground
`auvrynt serve`:

```powershell
auvrynt config set publicBaseUrl https://auvrynt.example.com
auvrynt serve
```

## Approve The Client

When ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Lovable, Bolt, or another MCP client connects, Auvrynt shows an Owner
token approval page. Enter the Owner token shown during setup, or retrieve it later with `auvrynt token`.

The default config files are:

```text
~/.auvrynt/config.json
~/.auvrynt/auth.json
```

Keep `auth.json` private.

## Connect Grok

Start Auvrynt with the integrations you need, then copy the public MCP URL from
`auvrynt status`:

```powershell
auvrynt start web
auvrynt status
```

In Grok, open `grok.com/connectors`, choose **New Connector** → **Custom**, and
paste the URL ending in `/mcp`. Grok must use the public HTTPS URL; it cannot
reach `127.0.0.1`. Complete the Auvrynt Owner-token approval when prompted.

For a URL that survives tunnel restarts, configure a reserved ngrok URL with
`auvrynt tunnel` before creating the Grok connector. Cloudflare quick-tunnel
URLs are temporary and must be replaced in Grok when they change.

## Check Your Setup

Run:

```bash
npx auvrynt doctor
```

The doctor command reports the resolved config, Node version, Node ABI, platform,
Git, Bash, public URL, allowed hosts, and SQLite native dependency status.

## Running From A Local Checkout

If you are developing Auvrynt itself instead of using the published package:

```bash
npm install --include=dev
npm run dev
```

The same setup rules apply.
