# WEB_AGENT_GUIDE.md

## Scope

This guide applies to web projects: websites, web applications, frontend SPAs, full-stack apps with a web UI.

Do not apply this to Godot projects, desktop applications, CLI tools, or pure backend services unless they expose a web interface.

---

## Core Anti-Hallucination Rules
- **Never invent** a tool name, parameter, return field, command, process ID, URL, file path, screenshot, test result, or browser state.
- **Use only tools** that are actually exposed in the current session.
- **Tool availability is evidence. Tool names imagined from documentation are not available tools.**
- Before calling a specialized tool, confirm its exact tool name and schema are available.
- If a desired specialized tool is unavailable, use the safest available fallback or report the limitation.
- Do not describe a tool call as completed unless its result was returned successfully.
- Do not assume a development server is running, or that a URL, port, browser page, process, or screenshot exists.
- Do not reuse stale process IDs, workspace IDs, page IDs, or browser session IDs.
- Do not guess framework commands when package scripts can be inspected.
- Do not call multiple overlapping tools that produce the same information without a clear reason.
- Do not load unrelated Godot, desktop, mobile, or general software tools for a normal web task.
- Do not continue calling tools after the task is already verified.
- When a tool result conflicts with memory or assumptions, trust the current tool result.

---

## Primary Tools

**Workspace**
- open workspace, read file, edit file, write file
- file search, text search, project inspection

**Process management**
- start process (persistent — never use a blocking shell for a long-running dev server)
- get process logs
- list processes
- stop process

**Browser automation**
- navigate
- inspect DOM
- inspect accessibility tree
- capture page screenshot
- inspect console messages
- inspect network requests
- viewport resize
- click / type / wait

**Image tools**
- view image, inspect image, compare images

**Build and validation**
- package-manager scripts (lint, type-check, test, build)

---

## Web Task Classification
Before executing any tool, classify the request into one primary task type:
- **A. Project inspection:** Framework, scripts, dependencies detection.
- **B. Bug fixing:** Code repair, hotfixes.
- **C. New feature implementation:** Adding new behavior, endpoints, routes.
- **D. UI implementation:** Adding visual layouts, components.
- **E. Website cloning or visual matching:** Replicating design from screenshot/reference.
- **F. Responsive testing:** Testing multiple viewports (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop).
- **G. Runtime debugging:** Fixing console errors, network request failures.
- **H. Build or test failure:** Compiler errors, test suites failure.
- **I. Performance investigation:** Auditing speeds, payload size, caching.
- **J. Accessibility review:** Inspecting roles, labels, contrast, keyboard focus.
- **K. Content-only edit:** Modifying static texts, links, images.
- **L. Deployment or production build preparation:** Validating build artifacts, production config.

## Tool Selection Decision Table

| Need | Preferred tool group | Do not use first |
|---|---|---|
| Find component | Workspace search | Browser screenshot |
| Start local app | Persistent process | Blocking shell |
| See runtime UI | Browser | Source read alone |
| Exact visual diff | Image comparison | Visual opinion only |
| Console exception | Browser console | Screenshot only |
| Failed API call | Network inspection | DOM inspection only |
| Build error | Build/validation | Browser |
| Change source | Edit tool | Shell redirection |
| Framework behavior | Official docs | Guessing |
| Mobile layout | Viewport/responsive tools | Desktop screenshot only |

---

## Required Workflow

1. Inspect `package.json` and relevant framework configuration.
2. Detect package manager from lockfiles (`package-lock.json` → npm, `yarn.lock` → yarn, `pnpm-lock.yaml` → pnpm, `bun.lockb` → bun).
3. Read existing scripts before choosing commands. Never guess a dev command when scripts exist.
4. Start the dev server using **persistent process tools** — never a blocking shell call.
5. Confirm the real local URL from startup logs. Do not invent a URL or port.
6. Navigate a browser tool to that URL.
7. Inspect DOM, accessibility info, console errors, and failed network requests as needed.
8. Capture screenshots at relevant viewport sizes.
9. Make minimal source changes. Preserve the framework and existing architecture.
10. Run the smallest useful validation after changes.
11. Compare screenshots when matching a reference design.
12. Stop unnecessary processes after the task is complete.

---

## Web-Specific Rules

- Do not install dependencies without checking the existing package manager; ask only when installation is truly required.
- Do not overwrite package configuration casually.
- Prefer semantic DOM inspection combined with screenshots over screenshots alone.
- Use browser tools only against the current project or an explicitly requested public URL.
- Protect against unsafe URL schemes (e.g. `file://`, `javascript:`) and SSRF.
- Allow `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` development URLs explicitly.
- Do not expose cookies, authorization headers, or secrets in responses.
- Do not download or copy proprietary website assets without permission.
- When cloning a design, reproduce layout and behavior without copying protected branding or code.
- Use exact viewport dimensions for reference comparisons.
- Distinguish resemblance from exact pixel similarity in image comparisons.
- Reinspect DOM after major re-renders before making further changes.
- Do not reuse stale process IDs, page IDs, or session IDs.

## Task-Specific Playbooks

### UI & Visual Matching Playbook
1. Inspect reference design/screenshot.
2. Locate components and styles.
3. Implement changes section by section.
4. Start dev server & capture candidate screenshot using identical viewport size.
5. Use image comparison tool to find differences. Adjust and repeat.

### Runtime Bug & Debugging Playbook
1. Start/reuse dev server.
2. Reproduce the bug in the browser.
3. Inspect console logs and failed network requests.
4. Locate responsible source file, patch it, and verify the console/network errors disappear.

### Build/Test Failure Playbook
1. Inspect package scripts, run failing script/command.
2. Capture concise compiler/test error.
3. Fix minimal source code, re-run command, verify success. Do not launch browser unless needed.

---

## Recommended Validation Sequence

1. Targeted type check or linter on changed files
2. Targeted tests
3. Browser: page loads, no console errors, no failed requests
4. Desktop screenshot
5. Mobile screenshot (if responsive task)
6. Screenshot comparison (if matching a reference)
7. Full production build (if requested or when verifying deploy readiness)

---

## Framework Notes

| Framework | Config file | Typical dev command |
|---|---|---|
| Vite | `vite.config.*` | `npm run dev` |
| Next.js | `next.config.*` | `npm run dev` |
| Nuxt | `nuxt.config.*` | `npm run dev` |
| Angular | `angular.json` | `ng serve` |
| Astro | `astro.config.*` | `npm run dev` |
| SvelteKit | `svelte.config.*` | `npm run dev` |

Always read `package.json scripts` to find the actual configured command. Do not assume defaults.

---

## Claim Verification Rules

| Claim | Required Evidence |
|---|---|
| **"The server is running"** | Process tool reports status `running`, and URL is confirmed. |
| **"The page loads"** | Browser tool successfully navigates to the page without error. |
| **"The bug is fixed"** | Original reproduction steps no longer fail, and lints/tests pass. |
| **"The UI matches the reference"** | Screenshots at matching viewports compared, diff box showing match percentage. |
| **"The page is responsive"** | Viewport resized to Mobile (375x667), Tablet (768x1024), and Desktop (1280x800) with no clipping. |
| **"The build passes"** | Actual successful build command output. |
| **"No console errors"** | Console logs inspected during page flow, returned empty or clean. |
| **"No failed requests"** | Network requests list inspected during page flow, showing only `2xx` / `3xx` codes. |

Never make stronger claims than the evidence supports.

## Serena (Semantic Code)

Serena provides language-aware symbol navigation for web projects. Start a session and use it selectively.

**Good uses:**
- Find a React component by symbol
- Find all references to a hook
- Inspect a TypeScript class
- Trace a route handler
- Rename an exported function
- Insert code into a known symbol
- Understand frontend/backend dependencies

**Bad uses:**
- Pixel comparison, CSS visual verification, browser interaction
- Console inspection, failed-request inspection
- Package-manager detection, dev-server startup

**Workflow:**
1. Start session: `serena_start_session({ workspaceId })`
2. Use semantic tools: `serena_find_symbol`, `serena_find_referencing_symbols`, `serena_get_symbols_overview`, etc.
3. Edit with Auvrynt edit tools or Serena mutation tools (`serena_replace_symbol_body`, etc.)
4. Run server and verify in browser

Serena does not replace browser verification.

## Do Not Include

- Godot editor bridge calls
- Scene-tree tools
- Game runtime tools
- Collision tools
- Godot export tools
- C# debugger tools (unless the project has a C# backend)
- Blender tools (unless the task involves editing a `.blend` source asset)
